# POSIX-Semaphores
POSIX Semaphores in Operating Systems Exercise

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a program in the C programming language that utilizes shared memory and semaphores for managing and synchronizing multiple processes. In this implementation, efficient cooperation between a parent process and multiple child processes is achieved using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms that ensure correct execution.
